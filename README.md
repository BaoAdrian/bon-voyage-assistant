# Travel Manager

This Alexa Skill-based application provides a streamlined process for scheduling a vacation! It solves the problem of trying to financially plan out a trip by looking at Lodging, Modes of Transportation, and cuisines local your destination to help give you a better idea of the overall cost of a trip to your desired destination.

This project leverages the following tools and technologies to achieve its functionality:
- AWS
   - Alexa Skill Kit
   - Lambda
   - S3 (Optional)
   - DynamoDB (Optional)
- APIs
   - American Airlines Flight-Engine (Deployed using Heroku)
   - Yelp

Note, mock data was utilized to represent the lodging and transportation data due to the limitation of free-access APIs for both sections. This was meant to simulate what data processing for those portions would appear like and how they would aid in processing with the Alexa commands.
